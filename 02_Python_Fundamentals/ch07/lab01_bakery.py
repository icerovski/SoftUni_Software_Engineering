'''
Your first task at your new job is to create a table of the stock in a bakery, and you really don't want to fail on your
first day at work.
You will receive a single line containing some food (keys) and quantities (values). They will be separated by a single
space (the first element is the key, the second â€“ the value, and so on). Create a dictionary with all the keys and
values and print it on the console.

line = input().split(' ')
bakery = {line[i] : int(line[i + 1]) for i in range(0, len(line), 2)}

print(bakery)
